# seq2seq_transforme
A PyTorch-based implementation of the Transformer architecture from scratch, designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. This repository demonstrates the development of a fully functional translation model, featuring attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and multi-head self-attention.
